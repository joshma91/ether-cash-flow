# Ether Cash Flow Tool

This tool allows users to analyze a range of blocks on the Ethereum blockchain by querying:

1. the number of blocks preceding and including the present block; or
2. a range of block numbers (inclusive)

The report that is generated displays information such as: 
- how much Ether was transferred in total
- which addresses sent or received Ether; and corresponding totals
- identification of which addresses are contract addresses
- and much more!
